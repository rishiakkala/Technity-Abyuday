# Tech Club Plan for the Next 6 Months - Rishi 🚀

## Skill Building Workshops 💡
Conduct a series of workshops tailored to the tech skills desired by team members. These workshops can cover a range of topics such as coding, web development, graphic design, data analysis, and many others. To enrich these learning experiences, consider inviting guest speakers from the tech industry who can share insights and real-life experiences. Encourage participation from members during these workshops so they can practice what they learn.

## Group Projects 👥
To foster collaboration and engagement within the club, form teams based on each member's interests and skill levels. Assign them tech-related projects that align with the club's core focus. Provide mentorship and guidance to these teams as they work on their projects. Regularly check in with them to monitor progress, offer support when needed, and address any challenges that may arise along the way.

## Hackathon or Coding Challenge 💻
Create a hackathon or coding challenge exclusively for club members. Establish a theme or problem statement for participants to solve within a timeframe. Make sure you provide them with resources and support throughout the event, as well as clear judging criteria for evaluating their projects or solutions. Finally, acknowledge achievements by recognizing and rewarding those who deliver projects or solutions during this event.

## Tech Networking 🌐
Organize informative sessions led by industry experts to delve into popular topics. Facilitate chances for members to forge connections, with one another as well as with the guest speakers. Explore career paths and possibilities within the tech industry. Take stock of the club's achievements in months. Gather input for further enhancement.

Throughout these 6 months, maintain open communication, adapt based on member feedback, and celebrate achievements to create an engaging and enriching experience. 🎉

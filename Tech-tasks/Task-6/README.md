# Task-6 🤖🎬

In this task, I created a cinebot:

**Step 1:** I ventured into the Telegram realm and engaged with the mighty BotFather to summon forth a bot. 🤖✨

**Step 2:** I marched to the command prompt, where I summoned the powerful packages telebot and requests with the mystical incantations `pip install telebot` and `pip install requests`. 🛠️🔮

**Step 3:** Armed with Python, I etched an intricate script that breathed life into my cinebot. Equipped with the sacred bot token bestowed by BotFather, I cast the spell to summon its presence. With bated breath, I gazed upon the results on Telegram. 👨‍💻📜🔥

And thus, a cinebot was born, dancing with the magic of movies and the wizardry of Telegram! 🎥🎩✨

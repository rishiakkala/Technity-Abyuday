# About Me 👋🎨

Hi, I'm Rishi! While I do have some experience in design, my journey has been outside the realm of clubs. But guess what? I'm thrilled to jump into this new adventure! My heart beats for UX designing, and I'm diving deep into it. 💼💡

I'm on a mission to master various design software, gearing up to use them in exciting future projects. My goal? Crafting user experiences that leave a lasting impact. 🚀🌟

# Design Club 6-Month Plan ðŸŽ¨ðŸš€

Over the upcoming 6 months, our design club is set to embark on an exciting journey. The initial phase will focus on welcoming new members and building foundational skills through workshops. As we progress, months three and four will see us diving into creative projects and collaborative endeavors. ðŸ’¡ðŸ‘¥

Stepping into the later months, our attention will turn towards showcasing our talents and further honing our skills. Members will craft their personal portfolios, gain insights from industry experts, and engage in advanced workshops tailored to specialized design areas. ðŸŒŸðŸ”§

Throughout this timeframe, we'll maintain a supportive atmosphere with regular design critiques and networking opportunities, facilitating connections with professionals. Our journey will culminate in an exhibition, where we'll proudly display our finest work. Prepare for a period of inspiration, growth, and creative synergy! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŒ±
